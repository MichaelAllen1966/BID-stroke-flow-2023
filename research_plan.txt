This research aims to reduce life-altering disparities in emergency stroke care by identifying and addressing hospital-level variations in the use of proven clot-removing treatments. By applying advanced modelling and 'artificial intelligence' techniques, we uncover not just the 'what?', but 'why?' and the impact of inconsistent care. This will pave the way for targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes and streamline healthcare resources.

1. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

Stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and disability, globally and in the UK. The majority of strokes are caused by a clot. Clots may be reduced or removed with reperfusion treatments if given soon enough after a stroke. These treatments include thrombolysis, a clot-busting medication given by injection/infusion [1] and, more recently, thrombectomy, mechanical removal of a clot performed in a specialist centre [2].

Despite thrombolysis being long-established and of proven benefit in ischaemic stroke, use of thrombolysis varies significantly both between hospitals. In England and Wales the national stroke audit reported that in 2021/22, thrombolysis rates for emergency stroke admissions varied from just 1% to 28% between hospitals [3], with a median rate of 10.4%, against a NHS England long term plan that 20% of patients of emergency stroke admissions should be receiving thrombolysis. Additionally, in 2022/23, 3.2% of all patients received thrombectomy, significantly below the expected eligibility of at least 10% of all patients [4].

In addition to variation in outcomes due to disparity in treatment of patients, there is potential for greater use of NHS resources than necessary; worsened outcomes can increase downstream healthcare needs.

Our research team uses various modelling techniques, including explainable machine learning and clinical pathway simulation to identify the variation that occurs across different hospitals during the first few hours of stroke care. We use these models to understand the the source and impact of that variation on patients [5;6]. We have identified that the majority of between-hospital variation in thrombolysis use comes from differences in hospital processes and decision-making, rather than from differences in local patient populations [5;6]. Additionally, we perform geographic analysis to study the variation in access to thrombolysis and thrombectomy [7].

We are working with the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme and NHS-England on reducing between- hospital variation in emergency stroke care. In this proposed project we will build on previous and existing work, extending the modelling, bringing it together into a single analysis framework and web application.

2 WHY IS THIS WORK IMPORTANT?

Reperfusion treatment is the mainstay emergency treatment for stroke. Unwanted variation in reperfusion treatment leads to avoidable variation in disability outcomes in stroke, which also has potential to cause unnecessary variation in downstream healthcare resource use. These methods are also potentially valuable in other healthcare settings where it is suspected that variation in healthcare and outcomes is due to variation in treatment processes and decisions rather than in differences in local patient populations.

3 REVIEW OF EXISTING EVIDENCE

Studies have shown that reasons for low and varying thrombolysis rates are multi-factorial. Reasons may often be organisational [9;10;11]. For many organisational factors, the establishment of primary stroke centres has been suggested to improve the emergency care of patients with stroke and reduce barriers to thrombolysis [11], with a centralised model of emergency stroke care leading to increased likelihood of thrombolysis [12;13;14].

In addition to organisational factors, clinicians can have varying attitudes on which patients are suitable candidates for thrombolysis. In a discrete choice experiment [15], 138 clinicians considered hypothetical patient vignettes, and responded as to whether they would give the patients thrombolysis. The authors concluded that there was considerable heterogeneity among respondents in their thrombolysis decision-making.

Based on national audit data we have previously built models of the emergency stroke pathway using clinical pathway simulation to examine the potential scale of the effect of changing two aspects of the stroke pathway performance (1. the in-hospital process speeds, and 2. the proportion of patients with a determined stroke onset time), and using machine learning to examine the effect of replicating clinical decision-making around thrombolysis from higher thrombolysing hospitals to lower thrombolysing hospitals [5;6]. Using these models we found that it would be credible to target an increase in average thrombolysis in England and Wales, from 11% to 18%, but that each hospital should have its own target, reflecting differences in local populations. We found that the largest increase in thrombolysis use would come from replicating thrombolysis decision-making practice from higher to lower thrombolysing hospitals. Two other important factors influencing thrombolysis rates were determination of stroke onset time in some hospitals, and improving the speed of the in-hospital thrombolysis pathway.

We have extended the model to including explainability [8]. This revealed that lower thrombolysing hospitals, were particularly less likely to give thrombolysis to patients with 1) mild stroke, 2) imprecisely known onset time, 3) patient with prior disability, 4) any combination of those. This work is now forming the basis of a web tool (bit.ly/sam2_app) that allows stroke teams to compare their thrombolysis decisions to others, and to see how changing the pathway process can change the use and speed of thrombolysis, and the effect on patient outcomes. Current work is now also focussed on learning patient outcome (disability level at discharge) based on patient characteristics and use of thrombolysis (https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR13432).

Our team is also performing modelling the effect of pre-hospital selection of patients for thrombectomy. We model how pre-hospital selection will effect time to thrombolysis and thrombectomy, and their outcomes (using a mathematical outcome model based on time to treatment).

1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND AIMS

We wish to extend our current work in the following ways:

* Thrombolysis in late-presenting and patients with wake-up stroke - we will update our existing models to align with new clinical guidelines that thrombolysis should be considered up to 9 hours for late-presenting and wake-up stroke patients, after advanced imaging for an assessment of whether there is still salvageable brain tissue.

* Analysis of variation in patient selection for thrombectomy - how do thrombectomy centres vary in their selection of patients for thrombectomy, and what is the likely affect on outcomes from this variation?

* Analysis of how variation in use of thrombolysis and thrombectomy effects in-patient length of stay - how do thrombolysis and thrombectomy affect length of stay in acute and rehabilitation units?

* Pilot work on a 'Digital Twin' stroke unit. This is an extension to our current clinical pathway simulation that will use more data, with rapid near-live model updating. Digital Twins allow problems to be identified earlier, and suggest actions to improve the situation. For example, when Apollo 13 suffered a fire, 210 thousand miles away from Earth, engineers in NASA experimented with a computer simulation of the Apollo spacecraft, which was kept up to date with the conditions aboard the crippled capsule. This allowed the engineers to experiment with a simulation that closely copied the state and behaviour of the actual spacecraft, to find a way to bring the astronauts safely home. This was the first significant example and use of a "Digital Twin".

* Production of a combined analytical pathway and web tool - this tool with provide a national and regional analysis of current thrombolysis and thrombectomy use and provision, and enable an analysis of what an optimal system may look like, and the effect that would have on patients and health services. The tool will be developed and refined with co-production workshops, as we work with stroke teams on local thrombolysis and thrombectomy improvement. The web tool, developed from our existing web tool (https://bit.ly/sam2_app) will combine:

  - Geographical analysis access to thrombolysis and thrombectomy. The map will identify which destination hospital would provide most likely best outcomes depending on type of stroke (of if stroke type is unknown).

  - Clinical pathway simulation (including the pre-hospital pathway) - showing how optimisation of the pathway may effect thrombolysis and thrombectomy use and speed.

  - Explainable machine-learning analysis of variation in choice of patients for thrombolysis and thrombectomy (with causal inference methodology to give further confidence in modelling).

  - A health economics model based on patient outcomes, extending patient outcome results to expected QALY (quality-adjusted life years).
  
5 PROJECT PLAN

5.1 DATA

We use anonymous patient-level data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP, strokeaudit.org). SSNAP collects data on essentially all emergency stroke units, from all stroke units in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The data includes a wide range of information such as data on times throughout the stroke pathway from stroke onset, pre-stroke disability (modified Rankin Scale, mRS), a breakdown of stroke symptoms using the NIHSS stroke scale, reperfusion treatment given (and timing), comorbidities, death in hospital, disability at discharge from inpatient care, and 6 month follow-up disability (the latter is complete for about 35% of discharged patients). Data is collected for about 85,000 patients each year, 10-11% of whom receive thrombolysis, and about 3% now receiving thrombectomy.

5.2 DESIGN

The methods used in this study have been used extensively by the team before, except for the additional of causal inference methodology to strengthen conclusions drawn from observational data. All work will be performed in Python using established libraries for each of the methods. Work will be conducted in Jupyter notebooks, all of which will be published in an online Jupyter Book as we do for all our work (e.g. see bit.ly/explainable-ml)

The major components of the project, with methods are as follows:

* CLINICAL PATHWAY SIMULATION: We use Clinical Pathway Simulation to model the flow of individual patients through the stroke pathway, with each patient having their own times drawn from distributions (created from observed data), and patient characteristics (e.g. age, stroke severity). Outcome is predicted based on time to treatment for thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy (or based on no treatment given). This model may be used to estimate the effects of changing process speed and efficiency, percentage of patients with ascertained stroke onset time, the likelihood any patient will receive thrombolysis at any hospital, and the choice of which type of hospital to which the patient is conveyed. These models may either be coded in NumPy for national scale models, or SimPy for regional models where more control is desired over patient flow. We are experienced in both of these methods [6;16].

* DIGITAL TWIN: A digital twin is a development from classical system simulation. Digital twins combine traditional simulation with live or near-live data so that the model captures how the system is at that time. The digital twin may be used for monitoring and forecasting, as well as always up-to-date and/or real-time 'what if?' analyses about the system behaviour and performance. We plan to perform pilot work based on data from CaptureStroke (https://capturestroke.com/), a real-time stroke pathway patient data acquisition system.

* EXPLAINABLE MACHINE LEARNING: We will use machine learning in a range of activities:

  - Learning and and prediction of treatment decisions at different hospitals. This allows us to learn general patterns of what makes patients suitable for thrombolysis in practice, and allows us to observe how any individual hospital differs from that norm. It also allows us to provide a benchmark decision for each patient based upon the majority vote of predicted thrombolysis decisions from a selected group of hospitals.

  - Learning and and prediction of outcomes with and without treatment. Learning outcomes from observational data extends our mathematical models based on clinical trial results, and allows more complex learning than available from clinical trials. All patients in the data set have estimated disability score prior to stroke, and disability on discharge assessed. We currently predict outcomes with and without thrombolysis, and will extend this to thrombectomy.
 
  - Learning and and prediction of inpatient lengths of stay and discharge destination. We will extend out machine learning to predict inpatient lengths of stay and discharge destination based on patient details, treatment, and hospital attended. This will allow us to evaluate how thrombolysis and thrombectomy affect lengths of stay and discharge destination independent of patient characteristics, and allow us to investigate any variation in length-of-stay that are attributable to the hospital (which will also me matched to outcomes as a counter-measure of length of stay).

We have tested a range of machine learning models (from logistic regression through to modular neural networks) [5], but now focus on using XGBoost. We add an explainable machine learning model, using SHAP, to show how patient features influence the model’s predictions. This is done at both patient and population level [8].

 * GEOGRAPHIC MODELLING: Geographic modelling is used to estimate travel times to closest thrombolysis and thrombectomy units, as well as the travel time between the two types of units when a secondary transfer is required. This type of modelling helps planners understand the likely impact of changes to configurations of health services. We use the Linux routino application with Open Street Map data for estimating travel times from all Lower Super Output areas to all thrombolysis and thrombectomy units. Mapping is performed using the Python Geopandas library.
 
* HEALTH ECONOMICS: Prof McMeekin has developed a Health Economics model for stroke based on age, sex, and disability at discharge. We already make this model available in our pilot web application (https://stroke-predictions.streamlit.app/Lifetime_mortality, and it is being written up for publication. As the model is based on disability at discharge we are able to use the same model in the proposed work that also includes thrombectomy as our modelling will estimate disability at discharge under varying scenarios.

* WEB APPLICATION: We have a pilot web application (https://bit.ly/sam2_app). We use Python-based StreamLit which enables data scientists to readily build and maintain web applications.

5.4 PATIENT AND CARER INVOLVEMENT

Our team has a dedicated PPI group who provide constant input into our work and have provided input to this bid. The PPI group have been a key voice in guiding our work to look most at what maximises patient outcomes, and not arbitrary targets on thrombolysis use. The PPI team is chaired by a stroke supervisor, with guidance from the University of Exeter PenARC PPI team.

5.5 CO-PRODUCTION WITH THE NHS, AND LINK TO PATIENT BENEFIT

During this project we will hold stakeholder workshops to obtain feedback on the work. This will use our existing stakeholder network across the SSNAP, Integrated Stroke Delivery Networks (ISDN) and Integrated Care Systems (ICS). As we are working alongside NHS-England and NHS-Elect with teams with low thrombolysis (see paragraph below), we will also use this experience to refine project outputs.

A pilot web portal is being made available from autumn 2023, providing analysis of thrombolyis use at each hospital, comparing decisions made to other hospitals, and providing modelling how changing process speeds or clinical decisions would likely effect thrombolysis use and outcomes (based on a mathematical model of outcome depending on time to thrombolysis). We will seek feedback from users of the web application.

The modelling work currently being performed is planned to be incorporated into the national stroke audit from Spring 2024. This will provide teams with realistic target thrombolysis use for their own patient population, and identify which area of the stroke pathway to focus on (for example pathway speed, ascertainment of stroke onset time, thrombolysis decision making). Additionally, NHS-Elect (who are working with NHS-England, our stroke modelling team, and the national stroke audit) have an NHS improvement target to “Improve access to thrombolysis such that by the end of 2027/28, 20% of stroke patients will receive thrombolysis treatment”. This collaborative will be working with 6 low-thrombolysing teams in the first instance, before extending work to all emergency stroke teams.

6 DISSEMINATION

In addition to working with the national stroke audit and stroke teams directly (see above), we will also publish our work in leading stroke journals, and present it at stroke conferences. All of our detailed work is published online (e.g. see https://bit.ly/explainable-ml).
