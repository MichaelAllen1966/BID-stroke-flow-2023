Access to thrombectomy depends on geography, with about 60\% of patients requiring a secondary transfer to a thrombectomy-capable unit after receiving thrombolysis at their local acute stroke unit. This effect may be mitigated either by selection of patients for thrombectomy as part of the pre-hospital pathway, or by efficient transfer processes.
